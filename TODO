 RaleighFS - TODO
==========================
The code is under heavy development, and this is just a list of thing that
can be done sometime in the future...

 Zcl
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 - Re-Write chunkq, buffer, stream, ...
 - Avoid buffer-copy in rpc, chunkq, stream...
 - Add flexible data type based on extent tree (raleighfs flow like)

 - Add some hash-table hash functions (murmur3, lookup3, ...)
 - Add some hash functions (ripemd, sha1, ...)

 - Add remote messageq plug and use the localq as server-backend.

 Raleigh Server
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 - memcached: 'verbosity' and 'stats' are not currently implemented.
 - redis: implement all the missing commands.
 - websock: expose a websocket interface for xyz protocol
 - v1: raleighfs plain text protocol
