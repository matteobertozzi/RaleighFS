 RaleighFS - Abstract Storage Layer
=========================================

How To Compile & Run
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To run the build process just type python build.py
     python build.py

To run the server:
     export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=./build/zcl/libs:./build/raleighfs/libs/
     ./build/raleigh-server/raleigh-server

Source Code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 - src/zcl                contains the abstraction classes and some tool
                          that is used by every piece of code.
 - src/raleighfs-core     contains the file-system core module.
 - src-raleighfs-plugins  contains all the file-system's pluggable objects
                          and semantics layers.
 - src/raleigh-server     currently contains the entry point to run a
                          memcache compatible (memccapable text protocol),
                          and a redis get/set interface server.
                          The in-memory storage is relegated in engine.{h,c}
                          and is currently based on a Chained HashTable or
                          a Skip List or a Binary Tree.
